My name is LI Hongyi, you can also call me Jessie. 

I am a fresh graduate from Singapore Management University (SMU) Master of IT in Business (Analytics Track) Program.

During graduation, I start to review my whole year journey of data analytics and I decide to reproduce my previous projects during master program as well as document more case studies that I will work on in my future data analytics journey. 

I hope you could be the witness of my growth from a freshman to a qualified data analyst!
